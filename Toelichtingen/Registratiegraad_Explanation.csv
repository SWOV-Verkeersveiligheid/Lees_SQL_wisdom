"For various reasons the police do not register all road traffic crashes and casualties.";NA;NA;NA;NA

"The completeness of a source is expressed in the reporting rate: the reported number devided by the true number (as percentage).";NA;NA;NA;NA
"The reporting rate is especially low for slighter accindents (just propery damage or slight injuries), for single accidents and for accidents where no motor vehicle is involved.";NA;NA;NA;NA
"Sometimes accidents involving elderly people in traffic are wronlgy classified as an illness. If a person involved dies from injury obtained in the crash, this meets the definition of a road traffic accident.";NA;NA;NA;NA
"There is no reason to assume that the type of road plays a role in the completeness of the reporting of fatal road cashes.";NA;NA;NA;NA
"However the type of vehicles that is regularly used on the type of road in question does indirectely ensure that the  completeness differs per road type.";NA;NA;NA;NA
NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
"The reporting rate is available by the following chacteristics: Month (Maand), Weekday (Weekdag), Time (Tijdstip), Region (Provincie), Transport mode (Vervoerswijze), Age (Leeftijd) , Sex (Geslacht).";NA;NA;NA;NA
